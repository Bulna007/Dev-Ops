How to enforce restrictions while elevating an normal user as sudoer?

Before understanding how to enforce restrictions on a sudoer, let us explore few things around sudo command:
1. How does an sudoer can execute super user commands?
by using sudo

sudo command
upon using sudo, the linux operating system prompts for sudoer password: *****, after authenticating the user, it executes the super user command onbehalf of "root"
	
by default: sudo command executes an bash command on-behalf of the root user only

2. How can a sudoer can execute a linux command onbehalf of any other user of Linux operating system?
sudo -u username command

3. How can a sudoer can execute a linux command onbehalf of any group?
sudo -g groupname command

Enforcing restrictions on a sudoer:
To enforce restrictions on sudoers permitting them to perform sudo operations we need to use aliases:
(or)
using aliases we can enforce restrictions on a sudoer

There are 4 types of aliases are there
1. user_alias  
2. runas_alias
3. host_alias
4. cmnd_alias

4. Cmnd_Alias
using Cmnd_Alias we can enforce restriction on a sudoer, defining which bash commands can be executed by the sudoer as a root using (sudo) command

#CMD ALIAS
Cmnd_Alias BASIC_ADMIN_CMDS=/usr/bin/ls,/usr/bin/touch,/usr/bin/apt,/usr/bin/useradd

steve ALL=(ALL:ALL) BASIC_ADMIN_CMDS

1. User Alias
If we want to promote a specific list of users as sudoers with restrictions enforced on them we have #4 options

1. /etc/sudoers (user section)
per each user make an entry in the usersection of the /etc/sudoers file, configured with restrictions interms of Aliases. but this results in duplicate entries per each user

2. /etc/sudoers (group section)
we can group all the users whom we want to promote as sudoers with restriction into one group, and promote the group of users as sudoers with restrictions

%groupname ALL=(ALL:ALL) ADMN_CMNDS

here these users we want to promote as sudoers are not related and we dont want to group them, so this is not an feasible option

3. /etc/sudoers.d/ directory
per each user create a new file inside the /etc/sudoers.d/ directory with username, making entry to promote the user as sudoer with restrictions. But this will also results into duplicate configuration across the user sudoer files

4. promote the user as sudoer by adding them into sudoers or adm group. but in this case we cannot enforce restrictions

so how to promote a specific list of users as sudoers by enforcing restrictions?
We can make use of User_Alias

User_Alias = is used for creating a Alias with specific list of users, we want to promote as sudoers with restrictions and use the alias to promote them as below

User_Alias SUPPORT_USERS=bob,joe,mark

#promote User_Alias of users as sudoers:
SUPPORT_USERS ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

here we are promoting all the SUPPORT_USERS alias of users as sudoers at one shot.
	
	
#2. Runas Alias
If we want to restrict sudoer to perform sudo operations onbehalf of a specific user/group only then we need to use Runas_Alias

For eg.. we want to promote steve as a sudoer, granting him to execute sudo operations only on glen or supportgroup of users only, we can do this using Runas_Alias

Runas_Alias DAYTON_OFC_USERS=joe,jack,glen,mark,%daytonsupportgroup

steve ALL=(DAYTON_OFC_USERS) ALL
           
Now steve is allowed to perform sudo operations for only the DAYTON_OFC_USERS (joe,jack,glen,mark and daytonsupportgroup users)					 
	

#4. Host Alias
We can grant an sudoer to execute sudo operations if the user is connected through a specific host machine only
Host_Alias ORG_HOSTS=192.168.10.11,192.168.10.13
user ORG_HOSTS=(ALL:ALL) ALL

syntax:-
User_Alias Host_Alias=Runas_Alias Cmnd_Alias
