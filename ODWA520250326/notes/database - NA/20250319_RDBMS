Database
---------
Database management system (DBMS) is an system software, that abstracts/hides the complexities in storing and accessing the data from the underlying Filesystem of the computer. The database takes care of storing the data on the the underlying Filesystem of the computer in an efficient way, so that it can be accessed or modified easily.
	
The developers of the software application dont has to write complex programming logic in persisting and retrieving the data on the Filesystem, rather they need to write programming logic in talking to the database software itself.
	
There are lot of advantages of using the database management system software:
1. it eliminates writing complex programming logic in storing/retrieving the data on the Filesystem, so that software applications can be build quickly and cost of development can be brought down
2. databases enforce security in storing/retrieving the data through authentication
3. databases has backup and retore process to handle crash or corrupted data
4. databases makes the data accessible over the network

There are different types of database management systems are available
1. Hierarchial database
2. Network database
3. Relational database
4. Object oriented database
5. No-sql or semi-structured database
6. object-storage database

From the above, many of them are out-dated and no more available, currently there are only 3 types of databases being popular used in the market
1. Relational database
2. No-sql or Semi-structured database
3. object storage database

Relational database management system (RDBMS)
How to talk to the RDBMS database asking to perform operations?
The RDBMS databases provides a standard language called "SQL" language, stands for structured query language. Using sql queries we can ask the database to perform different types of operations like 
	1. create table
	2. drop table
	3. alter table
	4. insert data
	5. update data
	6. delete data
	7. retrieve data	
	etc
	
These SQL Queries can be classified into 5 types
1. DDL (Data definition language)
create, drop, alter and trucate database objects like tables and views etc

2. DML (Data Manipulation Language)
insert, update and delete data within the tables

3. DQL (Data Query language)
select (retrieve) data from tables

4. DCL (Data control language)
granting and revoking the permissions on the database objects like tables, triggers, views etc
grant, revoke 

5. DTL (Data transaction language)
commit or rollback the data transaction

basic sql queries syntaxes:
1. create table
create table tableName(column1 dataType primary key, column2 dataType, column3 dataType);
for eg..
	create table customer(customer_no integer primary key, customer_nm varchar(50), age integer, gender varchar(6), mobile_nbr varchar(13));

2. insert the data into table
insert into tableName values(COL1_VAL, COL2_VAL, COL3_VAL);
for eg..
	insert into customer values(1, 'James', 12, 'Male', '989398383');

3. how to query or retrieve the data from table
select * from tableName;
for eg..
	select * from customer;

To identify different groups of tables that belongs to different applications we need to create schema in the database. A schema is group or collection of tables that can be used in an application

create database hrDatabase;
With this we create an empty schema/database;

use database;
for eg.. 
	use hrDatabase;
Now all the queries we execute will be applied against the hrDatabase


There are lot of database server softwares are provided by various different vendors in the marked based on the principles of RDBMS database. Few are opensource and others are commercial database servers as below
1. oracle database (commercial)
2. db2 (ibm)
3. postgres
4. mysql
5. microsoft ms-sql server
6. mariadb


For connecting to the database server and perform operations we need to use database client tools. each database vendor provides their own client tools and we have lot of third-party client tools are available 
1. oracle database = sql developer (client-tool)
2. mysql database = mysql workbench
3. postgres = pgadmin (gui) 
	
third-party tools
1. toad
2. dbviewer
3. aqua data studio
etc
