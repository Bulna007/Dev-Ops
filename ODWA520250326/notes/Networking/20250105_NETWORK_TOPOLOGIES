Network Topologies
------------------
The way the computers are inter-connected with each other forming a network is called network topology
There are #2 types of network topologies are there
1. Logical topologies
2. Physical topologies

1. Logical Topology
The logical topology indicates the way the data is being transferred between the computers of the network

2. Physical topology
The way the comptuers are inter-connected with other physically forming the network refers to Physical topology

There are 5 different topologies are there in inter-connecting the computers
1. Bus topology
2. Ring topology
3. Star topology
4. Mesh topology
5. Hybrid topology
