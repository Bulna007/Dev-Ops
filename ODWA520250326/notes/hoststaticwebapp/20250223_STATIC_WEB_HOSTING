How do we host an static web application?
Web Application comprises of web pages that is used for distributing/publishing the information about a business organization to the world. The business organization has to write the information describing the business services that offer interms of HTML pages.
	
HTML stands for hyper-text markup language, it is used for representing the information using fonts, colors, styles, images, audio and video etc so that it reaches to the people and makes an big impact on the customers.
	
Here the word markup means tags and the HTML language has been built out of tags. There are lot of pre-defined tags provided by the language that should be used in writing the content, so that it would be render using fonts, colors etc as described above.
	
For eg.. <b></b> is a pair of opening and closing tags in-between we can enclose the text content so that it will be rendered or displayed in bold font.
<b>good morning</b> = this "good morning" text will be rendered in bold font

upon writing the content in HTML format, the data or the content will be saved into an File itself, but the extension of the file should be ".htm" or ".html" to identify as an HTML Document.
	
Specialized software called Web Browsers are provided, that can understand or parse the HTML tags we have written in rendering the contents of the file with nice formatting as specified.

There are 2 types of web applications are there
1. static web application
In static web application, it comprises of static resources like HTML, Images, icons, audios, videos etc. These applications doesn't store any data as input from the user and always render the same static content as response back when the user interacting with them.
For eg.. all the news paper websites or wikipedia, yellow pages etc are good examples of static web applications.
	
2. dynamic web application
Incase of dynamic web application along with Web/HTML pages to render the information, these applications are packaged with software programs build using the programming languages like java/python/php etc. They take the input data from the enduser and passes it as an input to the software programs to perform operation and the output generated by these programs will be sent as response back to the user, hence the output generated by these dynamic web applications differs from one user to another.
