Ansible Roles
-------------
Ansible roles are the way through which we can package and distribute ansible playbook automation in a standardized directory structure, so that it can be reused across in building the automation

The Ansible has defined 8 standard directories into which the automation needs to be implemented, so the people upon distributed can discover and use it

ansible_role (root directory)
|-default
  |-main.yml
|-tasks
  |-main.yml
|-handlers
  |-main.yml
|-vars
  |-main.yml
|-files
|-templates
|-meta
  |-main.yml
|-tests
  |-main.yml
  
other than files/ and templates/ in rest of the directories a default main.yml is there.
  
1. default/main.yml = all the variables with default values are defined/configured that can be used by the tasks and handlers
2. files = all the static files that needs to be used aspart of the automation should be places under files/ directory
3. templates = all the jinja2 template files should be placed here
4. tasks/main.yml = all the playbook tasks that we want to execute aspart of the automation should be defined/declared inside tasks/main.yml

Incase if we have several tasks to be carried to achieve the desired state of the system like
  1. install jdk
  2. install tomcat server
  3. install maven
  etc
  
then instead of defining/declaring everything in tasks/main.yml, we can break them into multiple yaml files and import them into main.yml

tasks/
  |-install-jdk.yml
  |-install-tomcat.yml
  |-install-maven.yml
  |-main.yml
  
then import all these install-*.yml into main.yml as below  
main.yml
--------
import_tasks: install-jdk.yml
import_tasks: install-tomcat.yml
import_tasks: install-maven.yml

5. handlers/main.yml = all the handlers should be declared inside handlers/main.yml
6. meta/main.yml = The meta information about the role like author, licensing, maintainers, version etc is defined inside meta/main.yml (information file)
7. vars/main.yml = all the variables being used aspart of the role should be declared inside vars/main.yml
8. tests/main.yml = all the tests that has to be performed in testing the role should be declared here

How to create an ansible role?
------------------------------
Manually creating the standardized 8 directories in creating a role is quite difficult, to help us in creating the role ansible has provided an ansible-galaxy CLI tool using this we can quickly create standard directories with default files

1. create a role directory and inside it run the below command to initialize the directory layout of the role
ansible-galaxy init roleName

Now start implementing the automation as defined above in writing variables, tasks, handlers etc


How to use an ansible role within the playbook?
Inorder to use the roles, we need to place the roles inside any one of the 3 standard directories so that it can be used inside the playbook
1. within the playbook directory, we need to create an directory called roles/ in which we need to place the roles to be used aspart of the playbook

2. /etc/ansible/roles/ directory under which we can place all the roles globally.
  
3. we can define a property roles_path in ansible.cfg file pointing to the directory location where we want to place the roles under

once we place the roles in any one of the above defined directories, we can use the roles within the playbook as below:
- name: play
  hosts: all
  roles:
    - roleName
