init-level or run levels indicates how we wanted the linux operating system to be booted. There are 7 run levels are there from 0 - 6 to boot the linux operating system. To boot the linux operating system in a specific run or init level we need to use init followed by init-level

init - is an super user command we need to use super user privilige to run it.
	
1. sudo init 0 = shutdown/poweroff
2. sudo init 1 = single user-mode with no networking, no multi-tasking and only root access (similar to safe-mode in windows)
3. sudo init 2 = with network and multi-tasking but no gui
4. sudo init 3 = supports networking and multi-tasking, but no gui
5. sudo init 4 = same as init 3 run-level only. but reserved for research purpose
6. sudo init 5 = supports networking, multitasking with gui and sound
